# Health System Unity 3D (Dark Souls-like) 
## This tutorial is based on how to create a health system that functions very similarly to the well-known game, Dark Souls. Whenever the player takes damage, you'll see another colour health bar which simply indicates that you've taken damage, rather than simply the health bar going down.

1. Create a new scene in Unity, or if you already have a scene, open that up. 
2. Right click the hierarchy, hover over UI, and select Canvas.
3. Select 2D at the top of your scene to get a better view of the canvas, then click Canvas in the hierachy, right click then create empty object.

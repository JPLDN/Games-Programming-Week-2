# Health System Unity 3D (Dark Souls-like) 
## This tutorial is based on how to create a health system that functions very similarly to the well-known game, Dark Souls. Whenever the player takes damage, you'll see another colour health bar which simply indicates that you've taken damage, rather than simply the health bar going down.

1. Create a new scene in Unity, or if you already have a scene, open that up.

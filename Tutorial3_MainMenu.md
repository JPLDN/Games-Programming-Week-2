# Main Menu System 
## This tutorial shows how to make a Main Menu system with a Play, Options anc Quit button in Unity 3d, as well as another section with a back button after clicking options.

1. Create a new scene in Unity 3d and then right click the mouse button in the Hierachy, select UI, then click "Button - textMeshPro"
2. Move around the button with the move tool and place it where you'd like it to be. You can also adjust the button itself in the Rect Transform component, adjusting the scale and position more accurately.

### Now we're going to make so that, whenever your mouse hovers over the button, the opacity drops, and when you actually click the button, the opacity is now 100% and hard.

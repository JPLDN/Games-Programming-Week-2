# Main Menu System 
## This tutorial shows how to make a Main Menu system with a Play, Options anc Quit button in Unity 3d, as well as another section with a back button after clicking options.

1. Create a new scene in Unity 3d and then right click the mouse button in the Hierachy, select UI, then click "Button - textMeshPro"
2. Move around the button with the move tool and place it where you'd like it to be. You can also adjust the button itself in the Rect Transform component, adjusting the scale and position more accurately.

### Now we're going to make so that, whenever your mouse hovers over the button, the opacity drops, and when you actually click the button, the opacity is now 100% and hard.

3. On the button, go to the button component, for normal colour, on the A section, make sure that's set to 0. For Highlighted colour, you can choose what colour you want for the RGB sections, and make sure the A section is set to 77. For Pressed colour, again, adjust the colours to your liking for RGB's section, and this time the A section should be 123.
Lastly, for Selected Colour, you adjust RGB colours to your liking and then set section A to 255.
